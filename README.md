# CryptoSociety

The goal of this website is to educate the user in the art of classical cryptography, and provide a space to practice the skills learned.  For non-registered users, we provide a series of articles designed to teach the basics of cryptography, and offer some examples of breaking ciphers.  There is also a tool that can be used for either encrypting or decrypting short bits of text, for whatever reason a user may have.

Once a user registers with the site, the challenges section becomes available.  Challenges provide a chance to practice the skills learned here or elsewhere, by providing users a string of ciphertext, and allowing the user a chance to solve it.  Points are awarded for all challenges solved, and added to the user's profile.

Users can also create challenges for use by other members of the site.  The website will provide the encryption services for each challenge.  All the user must do is to specify the plaintext, the answer to the problem, and what cipher to use.

Right now, the site provides the challenges, walkthrough articles, and tool for encryption and decryption.  Long-term, we are hoping to integrate more social features, including a comments section or forum for the challenges and a leaderboard displaying high scores.
